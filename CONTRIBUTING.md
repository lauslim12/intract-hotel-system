# Contributing
When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owner of this repository (Nicholas Dwiarto) before making a change. 

## Pull Request Process
1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md and CHANGELOG.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files, package.json and the CHANGELOG.md to the new version that   this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme I use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/), but I only use the major update.
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
